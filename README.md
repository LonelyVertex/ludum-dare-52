## The Wheat Is Yellower

## About our game jam

Experience the thrill of collaborative game development with a unique project challenge! Inspired by the [Blackthornprod](https://twitter.com/Blackthornprod) where multiple people work on the same project without any extra information, we decided to try it ourselves. Five of us took turns working on the game for 5 hours each, with a strict time limit of 25 hours. The first person was given a theme and started with an empty project. The rest of us followed suit, adding our ideas and innovations to the game. Despite the time constraint, we had a blast working on this project. We hope you enjoy the final result of our fun and challenging exercise!

## About the Game

Get ready for an exciting and challenging farming adventure! As a farmer determined to bring in a successful harvest, you'll need to navigate through your neighbour's fields to gather as much wheat as possible before time runs out. But be careful - your neighbour and his trusty dog won't take kindly to your intrusion, and traps lie in wait to slow you down. Quickly gather the wheat with your harvester and race to your silo to unload your haul and add to your final score. And if you're not careful, you may need to repair your harvester in the garage. Can you outwit your neighbour and come out on top in this thrilling farming game?
